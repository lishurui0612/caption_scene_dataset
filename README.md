# A large-scale vision-language fMRI dataset for multi-modal semantic processing

## About
This repository provides codes for our large-scale fMRI dataset, focusing on four core components:
* Preprocessing pipelines for fMRI data
* Quality control tools for assessing preprocessing and data reliability
* Beta estimation using GLMSingle
* Voxel-wise encoding model code for caption stimuli

Participants performed a text–image semantic matching task in which captions and images were presented in an alternating sequence, and participants judged whether each pair conveyed the same meaning.
